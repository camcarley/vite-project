# __Sprouty Project__

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a CRUD web app using modern technologies that I want to gain experience with.

The endgoal is to be a re-write of my class capstone project, in which I used a Angular / C# / Bootstrap stack to develop the same application in which I contributed over 85% of the code for.


## Developed using:
- Build tool: Vite
- Testing: Vitest + @testing-library
- Package manager: pnpm
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Framework: React + TS
- Routing: react-router
